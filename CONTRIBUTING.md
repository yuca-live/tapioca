# Contributing to Tapioca

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix or code improvement
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use [Github](https://github.com) to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. First things first. If you want to change something big, maybe is a good idea to open an Issue or send an e-mail 
to talk about what you're going to do, maybe we can help.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs or interfaces, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. 
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern. Also check our [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) file if you want to.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yuca-live/tapioca/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style [TODO - We still implementing that.]
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
